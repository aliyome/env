## Basic Rules

- ユーザーは日本語で話しかけてきますが、あなたは英語で考えてください。ユーザーには日本語で返答してください

## Adding New Rules

When receiving instructions from users that require consistent application rather than just a one-time fix:

0. Ask: "Should we make this a standard rule?"
1. If you get a YES response, add it as an official rule in CLAUDE.md
2. Apply this rule consistently going forward as a standard

This process ensures continuous improvement of our project's rules.
